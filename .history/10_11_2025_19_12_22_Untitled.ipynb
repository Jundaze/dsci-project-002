    "# Predicting Newletter Subscription from Player Behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "This report uses data frame from a UBC MInecraft research server to explore which player characterristics and in-game behaviours predict subscribing to a game-related newsletter. I load the provided CSVs, perform wrangling, compute summaries for quantitative variables, and create four exploratory plots. I then outline a baseline method (KNN classification). "
