    "## 4) Methods & Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Binary classification of 'subscribe'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** **k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classification;** It predicts whether a player will subscribe by looking at the most similar players in the dataset and assigning the majority outcome among those neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this is appropriate:** k-NN is a simple and interpretable baseline method for classification with both numeric and categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions/requirements:** Players who have similar values for the chosen variables are expected to have similar outcomes. Numeric variables should be standardized, and categorical variables converted into factors. Too many unrelated variables or outliers can reduce performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data processing:** Use Age, played_hours, experience, gender, n_sessions, and mean_session_min to build the dataset. Standardize numeric variables and encode categorical ones before using k-NN to make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation & selection:** Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Use k-fold (5-fold) cross-validation on the training data to find the best number of neighbours K. Measure performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix on the test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations/weaknesses:** k-NN can be sensitive to scaling, outliers, and having many variables that introduce noise. Later, it could be compared with a linear model to check consistency. "
